      "likely that you will not be the only person working with and analyzing the data in your workbooks.\n",
      "This means it's essential that everyone working in the same workbook understands precisely what\n",
      "the formulas and functions are calculating. Although cell and range references make including\n",
      "figures in calculations and reusing those figures in multiple calculations easy, it's not always apparent\n",
      "at first glance what the formula is calculating. Manually typing or selecting cell and range references\n",
      "in large workbooks with many formulas can become tedious and potentially lead to errors. Wouldn't\n",
      "it be nice if there were a clearer, simpler way to include cell and range references in Excel?\n",
      "Excel 2010 enables you to name ranges for use in functions and formulas. Mastering this key trick to\n",
      "creating formulas and functions is an easy way to use the same ranges over and over in your\n",

      "Although you can come up with an incredible array of different names, there are some rules you\n",
      "must follow:\n",
      "• Names must begin with a letter, an underscore, or a backslash.\n",
      "• After the first character, names can contain letters, numbers, periods, and underscores.\n",
      "• Names cannot contain spaces.\n",
      "• Names cannot be the same as a cell or a range reference. For example, you cannot use $A$1 as a\n",
      "name.\n",
      "• Names have a defined scope, either to a worksheet or a workbook, and must be unique within\n",
      "that scope.\n",
      "• Names can contain up to 255 total characters.\n",
      "• Excel does not recognize casing differences for names. So, within the same scope, you cannot,\n",
      "for example, create both SalesTotals and salestotals as names.\n",
      "• You can use a single letter as a name, but you cannot do so by using either C or R in either\n",

      "In this lesson, you will automate workbook functionality. You will:\n",
      "• Apply data validation.\n",
      "• Work with forms and form controls.\n",
      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Let's face it: working with large workbooks presents a number of challenges. Entering large\n",
      "amounts of data can be time consuming and it's prone to errors. You may also find yourself\n",
      "spending a lot of time and effort performing the same few tasks over and over again. And,\n",
      "the more people who work in the same workbook, the more these types of issues become\n",
      "magnified. In short, as you develop ever larger and more complex workbooks, you'll want to\n",
      "find ways to automate any number of tasks to save time, reduce errors, and generally make\n",
      "using your workbooks easier.\n",
      "The good news is that Microsoft® Excel® 2010 includes a variety of features that allow you\n",
      "to do just that. From ensuring that only the correct data or type of data can be entered into\n",
      "your worksheets to performing repetitive task so you don't have to, Excel's automation\n",
      "features can save you valuable time and keep your data intact.2\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Apply Data Validation\n",
      "The single most important aspect of data analysis is having accurate data to analyze. Given the large\n",
      "number of people who may use your workbooks, it's essential that you be able to trust the data they\n",
      "enter. Only a few bad entries can have a chain-reaction-like effect on formulas and tables\n",
      "throughout large workbooks. What can you do, short of standing over someone's shoulder as he or\n",
      "she enters data, to ensure your massive amounts of data are valid? This seems a near-impossible task\n",
      "to achieve.\n",
      "Excel provides you with a robust and flexible way to make sure only valid data is entered into your\n",
      "worksheets: data validation. Understanding precisely what Excel enables you to control, and how to\n",
      "configure your worksheets to accept only correct entries, will allow you to take control of your\n",
      "worksheets and rest assured that you're avoiding major data errors that could take endless hours to\n",
      "locate and resolve.\n",
      "Data Validation\n",
      "In Excel, you use data validation  to restrict data entries in worksheet cells. You can use data\n",
      "validation, for example, to limit cell entries to values above, below, or between particular thresholds;\n",
      "to only positive values; to only date values; or even to one of a selection of options from a drop-\n",
      "down menu. Data validation helps to ensure that your worksheet users cannot enter data that would\n",
      "cause unwanted results by enabling you to define restrictions on the data they enter. Data that does\n",
      "not meet the requirements of data validation is known as invalid data .\n",
      "It is important to keep a few things in mind when applying data validation to your workbooks. First,\n",
      "data validation does not work on data that is copied and pasted or dragged to a cell; it works only on\n",
      "data that is manually entered. In fact, copying data to a cell to which you have applied data\n",
      "validation may clear the data validation from the cell. Additionally, although you can apply data\n",
      "validation to cells that already contain data, Excel will not notify you about nor change any existing\n",
      "data that does not meet the specified data validation criteria. Keep in mind that data validation is\n",
      "best suited for preventing erroneous data entries, and not malicious attempts to corrupt data. Use\n",
      "cell protection to prevent users from purposely entering bad data.\n",
      "The Data Validation Dialog Box\n",
      "You will use the Data Validation  dialog box to apply validation to worksheet cells and to manage\n",
      "existing data validation criteria. The Data Validation  dialog box is divided into three tabs: the\n",

      "between 13 and 57, or less than or equal to 1,000.\n",
      "Decimal This criteria type is nearly identical to the whole number criteria type. The\n",
      "only exception is that it allows for values containing decimals.\n",
      "List This criteria type enables you to set a pre-determined list of options as the\n",
      "only valid data for the cells. You can either enter the list of options\n",
      "directly into the Data Validation  dialog box, or reference a range of cells\n",

      "users with in-cell drop-down menus they can use to enter the data. You\n",
      "can also opt to allow them to manually enter the list items.\n",
      "Date This criteria type is similar to both the whole number and the decimal\n",

      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Microsoft® Excel®'s formulas and functions provide you with a robust set of options for\n",
      "performing complex calculations on the data in your workbooks. But on their own, they\n",
      "may not always perform the precise calculations you need them to. For example, you may\n",
      "need a function to reference a value from another dataset based on some particular criteria.\n",
      "But, how do you tell the function how to look that up? Or perhaps you need one of your\n",
      "arguments to be the result of another formula or function. Although you could always enter\n",
      "that formula or function in another cell and then simply include a reference to that cell as an\n",
      "argument in the original function, this could quickly take up a lot of real estate on your\n",
      "worksheet, which isn't always desirable.\n",
      "Excel provides options for dealing with these and many other situations. But doing so\n",
      "requires an understanding of a new set of Excel functions, Lookup functions, and a deeper\n",
      "understanding of function syntax. By investing the time it takes to elevate your\n",
      "understanding of how these functions work and how they work together, you'll begin to\n",
      "develop the ability to create incredibly complex functions and formulas that can perform\n",
      "any number of calculations. In short, you'll begin to understand how to, essentially, program\n",
      "Excel to perform tasks that you can't use the built-in functions to perform.3\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Use Lookup Functions\n",
      "So, you've collected a massive amount of data about your operations, upon which you can perform\n",
      "an amazing variety of analysis. But what if you want quick access to just a particular bit of data? In\n",
      "some cases, you may be able to search for it. But suppose you don't know what the value is. For\n",
      "example, what if you need to find out who employee 1287's manager is or in which region he or she\n",
      "works? If you don't know the answer you're looking for, you don't know what search criteria to\n",
      "enter. Or perhaps you need to enter the total number of units sold for a particular product into a\n",
      "formula. Although you could search for the product and look up the value yourself, you wouldn't\n",
      "want to do this for multiple products over and over.\n",
      "Fortunately, Excel 2010 enables you to look up such values, even in massive datasets, with relative\n",
      "ease. By using a set of functions known as Lookup functions, you'll be able to look up or include in\n",
      "a formula any one particular entry in any dataset. This level of functionality can quickly give you a\n",
      "detailed view of how any one individual value contributes to the overall operation of your\n",
      "organization. This can help you make clear, informed decisions that affect large-scale operations\n",
      "based on just a single chunk of data.\n",
      "Lookup Functions\n",
      "In Excel, Lookup functions do exactly what you'd think they would: They look up some value.\n",
      "Specifically, Lookup functions search through a particular dataset to return a particular value based\n",
      "on some criteria. Take a look at this simple example of how you might use a Lookup function.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "In this example, the Lookup function is looking up employee 1004's salary. A lookup function can\n",
      "identify the range A2:E11 , search down column A until it finds 1004, and then look across the row\n",
      "to the Salary  column to return the result $76,000. Lookup functions can perform other tasks as\n",
      "well. For example, they can look across a row to find the lookup value, and then count down rows\n",
      "to return another value. They can return a value in the equivalent location as another value in\n",
      "separate ranges. Or, they can return a value's place in a range.\n",
      "The particular Lookup function in the given example, which is in cell B14, references cell B13. So,\n",
      "for any employee ID a user enters, the function will return the salary. And, to add another level of46  |  Microsoft ® Office Excel ® 2010: Dashboards\n",
      "Lesson 3: Applying Conditional Logic  |  Topic A\n",
      "functionality, you could add a data validation drop-down list in cell B13 to create a dashboard tool\n",
      "that looks up the salary for any selected ID. Now, take this one step further and assume cell B14 is\n",
      "an argument in another function that performs some calculation based on the returned salary, say\n",
      "the employee's bonus for the year. It's easy to see how quickly a simple Lookup function can add\n",
      "complexity and functionality that produces valuable results.\n",
      "As is the case with all Excel functions, the key to leveraging Lookup functions is understanding\n",

      "nest, this section will mainly focus on presenting a couple of examples of nested functions and then\n",
      "breaking down the syntax into chunks to examine the specific calculation.\n",
      "Before looking at a few examples, however, there are some important points to keep in mind\n",
      "regarding nested functions:\n",
      "• Any function used as an argument must return a value of the same data type as the argument.\n",
      "• You do not include the equal sign ( = ) before a nested function, but all remaining function\n",
      "syntax is the same as it usually is for the function. You still must include the equal sign before the\n",
      "first-level function.\n",
      "• Each function, both the first-level function and all nested functions, must have a complete set of\n",
      "parentheses. These can become tricky to track, but they must all be present.\n",
      "Now, let's take a look at two examples.\n",
      "In this first example, the user is trying to determine if members of a group of sales reps qualify for a\n",
      "bonus. The bonus is based on meeting two criteria: having sales greater than $3,000 and having sold\n",
      "more than 2,000 units of product. It's easy to use an IF function to determine whether or not\n",
      "someone qualifies for a bonus based on a single criteria, but what about two criteria? For this, you'll\n",
      "need to nest an AND function within an IF function.\n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "Here, the AND function is being used as the logical_test  argument in the IF function. So the\n",
      "logical test includes both conditions stipulated by the AND function. As Allen has met only one of\n",
      "the conditions set out in the AND function, the IF function returns a value of FALSE. Remember\n",
      "that the logical_test  argument can be either a logical test or a logical value. As the argument\n",
      "evaluates to the logical value FALSE, the IF function returns the value_if_false  value, which in this\n",
      "case is \"No Bonus.\"\n",
      "Note: Note that the AND function contains a complete set of parentheses and is fully contained\n",
      "within the space between the IF function's opening parenthesis and the IF function's first\n",
      "comma. This makes sense, as the entire AND function is the IF function's first argument. The\n",
      "IF function ignores the comma within the AND function's parentheses as it is only looking for\n",
      "the value returned by the AND function.\n",
      "In this second example, the user is calculating commission payments for a group of sales reps. But\n",
      "the particular commission rate depends on the sales volume generated by each rep. If the rep's sales\n",
      "are less than $2,000, he or she receives a 5-percent commission. If sales are between $2,000 and\n",
      "$4,999, the commission rate is 7 percent. If sales are $5,000 or more, the rep receives a 9-percent\n",
      "commission. If this were only a matter of two different rates, a simple IF function would suffice.\n",
      "But how do you add the second logical test? You nest one IF function within another.\n",

      " \n",
      "Let's break down the function's syntax. If this had been a case of applying one of two commission\n",
      "rates, say either 5 or 7 percent, the function could have looked like this:\n",
      "=IF(B2<2000, B2*0.05, B2*0.07)\n",
      "But there is a third condition. Instead of telling Excel to multiply any value greater than $2,000 by a\n",
      "single value, you have to specify a second logical test. This second logical test, on its own, would\n",
      "typically look something like this:\n",
      "=IF(B2<5000, B2*0.07, B2*0.09)\n",
      "This function should be included as the third argument in the original function, without the leading\n",

      "=IF(B2<2000, B2*0.05, IF(B2<5000, B2*0.07, B2*0.09))\n",
      "If you were to read this function aloud, it would sound something like, \"If the value in cell B2 is less\n",

      "data on a worksheet when you're trying to present. You want to give them a simple, easy-to-\n",
      "digest view of important data so they can quickly understand what's really important.\n",
      "In short, you need a way to generate visual representations of your data. Excel 2010 includes\n",
      "some handy functionality that can convert your raw or analyzed data into visually clear, easy-\n",
      "to-interpret diagrams with just a few steps. Taking the time to understand how this\n",

      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Create Charts\n",
      "Let's face it, long strings of data are simply difficult for people to read and interpret. And, in today's\n",
      "fast-paced, data-driven world, most people don't have the time to sit down and pore over\n",
      "worksheets to get the information they need. Often, decision makers are looking for only a snapshot\n",
      "of just the most relevant information. And, as an Excel user, it's likely your job to provide that\n",
      "snapshot for them.\n",
      "Now that you've amassed, organized, and analyzed your data, you need to convert all of the figures\n",
      "and labels into a picture that makes a clear, simple statement. The good news is that, in Excel, this is\n",
      "quite simple to do. And, what's even better is once you convert your data in to easy-to-view visuals,\n",
      "you can keep those visuals up to date just as easily as you can your data.\n",
      "Charts\n",
      "Charts  are graphical representations of the numeric values and relationships in a dataset. Charts help\n",
      "worksheet viewers to quickly and easily interpret the data in a worksheet.\n",
      "Figure 4-1: A pie chart on an Excel worksheet.\n",
      "In this figure, while you can tell from the values in the Total Sales (in billions)  column what the\n",
      "sales are for each market, the pie chart to the right of the data is much easier to interpret. With just a\n",
      "glance, you can tell that North American sales account for more sales than the other three regions,\n",
      "and that they account for more than a third of all sales. Getting this information from the raw data\n",
      "would require a bit of analysis and some calculating.\n",
      "Chart Basics\n",
      "Although there is a wide variety of charts available in Excel 2010 to chart a number of different\n",
      "types of data, most of the chart types follow the same basic conventions. Most of the commonly\n",
      "used chart types in Excel plot data along two axes, the X axis and the Y axis. The X axis is the one\n",
      "that runs horizontally along the chart. It is typically used to represent a category of information,\n",
      "such as fiscal quarter or department. The Y, or vertical, axis is typically used to represent values\n",
      "within your dataset, such as sales totals or number of products shipped. The objects displayed in the\n",
      "chart, such as bars, columns, or lines, typically represent the individual items, or series, for which\n",

      "Lesson 4: Visualizing Data with Basic Charts  |  Topic ACharts\n",
      "Chart Basics\n",
      "Because Excel pulls data from your worksheets to create charts, it's important to understand how\n",
      "Excel reads your data to create them. Excel pulls the elements plotted along the X axis, or the\n",
      "categories, from your column labels. It identifies a data series based on the row labels from the\n",
      "selected dataset. Excel reads the values in the remaining cells as the values to plot against the Y axis.\n",
      "Figure 4-2: Using simple sales data to chart relative sales by region.\n",
      "Note that, in the figure, the categories along the X axis correspond to the worksheet column labels,\n",
      "which in this case are fiscal quarters. The data series, represented by the columns on the chart,\n",
      "represent different global regions, which Excel pulled from the row labels. The data entered into the\n",
      "remaining cells are the values against which the series are plotted.\n",
      "Of course, not all charts work exactly like this, but most of the commonly used charts do. The most\n",
      "notable exceptions are the pie chart, which you will typically use only to chart a single column of\n",
      "data, and the bar chart, which essentially turns a column chart on its side.\n",
      "Chart Types\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes 11 different chart types, each of which is ideal for displaying a particular type of\n",

      "It's important to remember to include row and column labels in your selection and to have your data\n",
      "entered correctly. For example, the categories you want plotted along the X axis should be your\n",
      "column labels, and the desired data series should be the row labels. Once you have ensured that your\n",
      "data is properly entered on the worksheet, and you have selected the desired range, you have three\n",
      "general options for inserting a chart: ribbon commands, the Insert Chart  dialog box, or inserting\n",

      "instantly create the default chart type out of any selected dataset.\n",
      "Note: Use the Set as Default Chart  command on the Insert Chart  dialog box to set the\n",

      "your message instead of your worksheets.\n",
      "What are a couple of reasons you would include charts in your workbooks?\n",
      "A: Answers will vary, but many users will likely find charts useful for regular meetings at which status\n",
      "updates are frequently presented. The use of charts is a quick and easy way to demonstrate\n",
      "progress. Also, users are likely to find charts helpful when breaking down overall and periodic figures,\n",

      "• Create sparklines.\n",
      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Often, images can tell a story or provide insight in an instantaneous fashion that isn't always\n",
      "possible with words and numbers. When presenting complex relationships among various\n",
      "bits of data to large groups of people, you may often find it easier to display a chart or a\n",
      "graph instead of asking the audience to pore over massive amounts of data to see your\n",
      "point. Data and relationships can be complex, and the basic charts in Microsoft® Excel®\n",
      "aren't always sufficient for displaying such complexity. For example, you may wish to\n",
      "display a variety of relationships within a single chart or you may want to graphically display\n",
      "how values relate to each other for massive datasets with far too many entries to reasonably\n",
      "display on a chart. In these cases, you'll need to go beyond creating simple pie or column\n",
      "charts to get the right message across.\n",
      "Fortunately, Excel's capabilities for graphically presenting data go well beyond the use of\n",
      "simple chart types. Investing a bit of time now to fully understand what these capabilities\n",
      "are and what they can do will give you the ability to make visual sense of your complex data\n",
      "for nearly any type of presentation or delivery situation.5\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Use Advanced Chart Features\n",
      "Have you ever needed to graphically display two widely different sets of data simultaneously? For\n",
      "example, you may wish to show how unit sales correlate to overall sales totals within the same chart.\n",
      "It's likely that the figures for total sales are much higher than they are for the number of units sold;\n",
      "after all, many items cost far more than a dollar these days. Putting both figures on the same chart\n",
      "would likely make at least one of the data series difficult to read. Or suppose you want to display\n",
      "future projections for your datasets on the same chart you use to display the data itself. Without the\n",
      "future data, how can you create chart elements that visually convey the information you wish to\n",
      "share? What if you have to create a lot of these charts? Does all of this mean a lot of extra data\n",
      "entry, calculation, and formatting?\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes a wide range of advanced charting features that enable you to display widely\n",
      "varying sets of data together, include forecasting trends on your charts, and reuse highly stylized or\n",
      "formatted charts again and again. It almost goes without saying that this level of functionality means\n",
      "you can quickly make an impact on nearly any presentation without having to put a lot of time and\n",
      "effort into doing so.\n",
      "Dual-Axis Charts\n",
      "A dual-axis chart is, simply, a chart that displays two sets of information on the same chart. This can\n",
      "be in the form of a dual-Y-axis chart, which displays two data series simultaneously, or a dual-X-axis\n",
      "chart, which displays two categories simultaneously. By far, dual-Y-axis charts are used far more\n",
      "frequently than dual-X-axis charts. But dual-X-axis charts can be useful for particular types of\n",
      "charts, such as bubble charts or XY (scatter) charts. Excel supports dual-axis charts only for 2-D\n",
      "chart types; they do not work with 3-D chart types. You can create a chart with a secondary X axis\n",
      "only if it already has a secondary Y axis.\n",
      "The main advantage to dual-axis charts is the ability to not only display two different sets of data\n",
      "simultaneously, but also to format the different sets of data independently of each other. This means\n",
      "you can make the two data series easily visually distinguishable from each other and display within\n",
      "the same amount of space using different scales. For example, you can simultaneously display unit\n",
      "sales figures, which may range in the thousands, with total sales figures, which could range in the\n",
      "billions of dollars for expensive equipment. Clearly, the data that is expressed in billions of units\n",
      "would be far easier to see within the same Y axis scale than the data with figures in the thousands. In\n",

      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "You've already seen the way Microsoft® Excel® functions and features can help you drill\n",
      "down into your data to get answers to very specific questions. Although using sorting and\n",
      "filtering is often a good option for attaining specific answers, these aren't necessarily the\n",
      "best options if you need to frequently change the questions you're asking of your data. To\n",
      "change the question you're asking when using functions, sorting, and filtering, you often\n",
      "need to rewrite functions, adjust criteria, or re-filter you data; sometimes, you need to use\n",
      "several of these methods at the same time. If you work in a high-paced, data-intensive\n",
      "environment, you simply may not have the time needed to recalculate every time a\n",
      "supervisor asks you a different question. You need something a little more dynamic.\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes a powerful feature that enables you to ask any number of questions of\n",
      "your data; get detailed, specific answers; and do it all over again in just a matter of moments.\n",
      "By using PivotTables to analyze your data, you can get critical, time-sensitive organizational\n",
      "intelligence to the people who need it quickly, easily, and with a high level of flexibility.6\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Create a PivotTable\n",
      "To take advantage of the functionality and flexibility of PivotTables, you must first understand how\n",
      "to create them. Although this is a relatively simple process, you must also know a bit about the type\n",
      "of data that works best for PivotTables. By taking a few moments to gain this foundational level of\n",
      "understanding, you'll be preparing yourself to create useful, effective PivotTables that you can use to\n",
      "analyze your raw data in incredibly fine detail.\n",
      "Pivoting\n",
      "Pivoting  allows you to view your data from a variety of new perspectives. In Excel, pivoting is a form\n",
      "of data manipulation that can take a column of data and pivot it into a row and vice versa. While this\n",
      "may not seem highly useful at first, think about it in terms of reorganizing and summarizing data\n",
      "based on a number of criteria. For example, let's say you have a dataset that contains rows of data,\n",
      "each representing a single event, such as a sale, a shipment, or a financial transaction. Each row\n",
      "would be composed of cells in a series of columns that each represent a single aspect of the\n",
      "individual events, say a particular date, dollar amount, or location. If you want to compile particular\n",
      "data about these events as a whole, say to find the total sales that occurred at each of the various\n",
      "locations, you could take the location column and pivot it so that it appears as a series of rows with\n",
      "each unique location being represented by an individual row. Location is your first criterion.\n",
      "Your second criterion is sales figures. In the original dataset, each row represents a single sale. The\n",
      "sales figures for all of the sales were in the same column, and each was associated with one of the\n",
      "locations. Now that the locations are represented by individual rows in the pivoted dataset, you want\n",
      "to know the total value of all sales from the dataset for each location. Manually calculating this\n",
      "would take some time; however, asking Excel to look at every sales entry for each location, sum the\n",
      "values together, and then return the total value for each location in the new rows would save all that\n",
      "manual effort. Once done, you would have just successfully pivoted a single column into multiple\n",
      "rows and summarized a particular data entry for each to answer a very specific question: how much\n",
      "in total sales was generated for each location? This simple example shows the power of pivoting.\n",
      "Note: As with filtering and sorting, pivoting does not affect your raw data; it only modifies your\n",
      "view of the data.\n",
      "Here's a look at how the previous example would work in a worksheet.\n",

      "Lesson 6: Analyzing Data with PivotTables, Slicers, and PivotCharts  |  Topic APivoting\n",
      " \n",
      "Here, you can see that, in the original dataset, each sale is listed as a separate entry. Store locations,\n",
      "in the form of location codes, appear within a single column. In the pivoted dataset, that column has\n",
      "been pivoted into rows, with each location being represented by a single row. For each location,\n",
      "Excel has summed each sale and calculated the total sales per store. Excel also calculated the total of\n",
      "all sales for all locations.\n",
      "PivotTables\n",
      "A PivotTable  is a dynamic Excel data object that enables you to analyze data by pivoting columns and\n",
      "rows of raw data without altering the raw data. PivotTables are effective for summarizing large\n",
      "volumes of data according to two or more criteria to return specific answers to your questions.\n",
      "PivotTables combine some of the most powerful and useful types of Excel functionality, such as\n",
      "sorting, filtering, summary functions, and subtotals, to give you an incredible level of control over\n",

      "structure translates into actionable intelligence are the keys to getting the answers you seek.\n",
      "Start with Questions, End with Structure\n",
      "To create PivotTables that will be useful to you, begin by thinking about the types of questions you\n",

      "a formula. Once you've determined what question you want Excel to answer, you can begin to\n",
      "design the structure of your PivotTable.\n",
      "There are a couple of items to keep in mind before beginning this process. First, it's typically best to\n",
      "create rows and columns out of fields that have a fairly finite set of entries, such as sales reps,\n",
      "regions, or products. You may not, for example, find it very useful to create rows out of dates that\n",
      "occurred over a 10-year span of time as you could end up with thousands of rows of data. Second,\n",
      "you should create rows out of the field for which you are primarily interested in determining some\n",

      "sales per product for each sales rep in your department, you would typically create rows out of sales\n",
      "reps (your primary concern) and columns out of the products (the items for which you are\n",
      "measuring performance). Then you would ask Excel to use the SUM function to total the sales for\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether you need to crunch numbers for sales, inventory, information technology, human resources, or other organizational purposes and departments, the ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time can create a powerful competitive advantage. After all, the world runs on data more than ever before and that's a trend not likely to change, or even slow down, any time soon. But with so much data available and being created on a nearly constant basis, the ability to make sense of that data becomes more critical and challenging with every passing day. You already know how to get Excel to perform simple calculations and how to modify your workbooks and worksheets to make them easier to read, interpret, and present to others. But Excel is capable of doing so much more. To gain a truly competitive edge, you need to be able to extract actionable organizational intelligence from your raw data, and present it in a visual format that enables decision makers to view key trends and conclusions at a glance. And that's exactly what this course aims to help you do.\n",
      "This course builds upon the foundational knowledge presented in the Microsoft® Office Excel® 2010: Part 1 (Second Edition) course and will help start you down the road to creating advanced workbooks and worksheets that you can use to create dashboards.

      "Use specialized functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "You already know how to get Microsoft® Excel® to perform simple calculations to make your job easier. However, manually entering formulas will take you only so far. The commonly used functions in Excel may not be enough to handle more complex data analysis needs. As you progress with Excel, and as you are called upon to provide a deeper understanding of your organizational data to decision makers, you'll need to know how to ask Excel more complex questions about your data and to get the answers you expect.\n",
      "Of course, the more complex your data analysis tasks are, the more complexity you're likely to need in your formulas and functions. This means that you'll need to know how to talk to Excel at a higher level to get the most out of your data. As with mathematics in general, and all forms of computer programming, understating the language Excel speaks is the key to having conversations with Excel and getting the answers you need.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Use Range Names in Formulas\n",
      "It is a rare individual who works without coming into contact with other people. As such, it is highly likely that you will not be the only person working with and analyzing the data in your workbooks. This means it's essential that everyone working in the same workbook understands precisely what the formulas and functions are calculating. Although cell and range references make including figures in calculations and reusing those figures in multiple calculations easy, it's not always apparent at first glance what the formula is calculating. Manually typing or selecting cell and range references in large workbooks with many formulas can become tedious and potentially lead to errors. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a clearer, simpler way to include cell and range references in Excel?\n",
      "Excel 2010 enables you to name ranges for use in functions and formulas. Mastering this key trick to creating formulas and functions is an easy way to use the same ranges over and over in your worksheets and to make those formulas and functions clearer to others who view and work in your workbook files. This is truly one of the most powerful features of Excel. Once you know how to name ranges and refer to those ranges by name in your formulas, you'll be developing complex, interconnected worksheets, including robust and highly informative dashboards, in no time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell and Range Names\n",
      "Cell names and range names are exactly what they sound like. They are meaningful names you assign to a given cell or range to make it easier to both understand what calculations are being performed in a formula and reuse the references for a number of purposes. Take a look at the following image, which shows two versions of the same formula, one using cell references and one using named cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1-1: The same formula using cell references and names.\n",
      "Now, imagine that you open this workbook months, or even years, after you created it. At first glance, which formula is easier to interpret? And, if you share this workbook with a colleague, which would make it clearer to the workbook recipient what her or she is looking at? It's pretty clear how powerful a feature this is.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, cell and range names are concise, descriptive names you can assign to cells or ranges for the purpose of making formulas easier to read and maintain. You can assign a name to both\n",

      "contiguous ranges and noncontiguous ranges. Names refer to absolute references by default but you can change those to relative references to facilitate the reuse of formulas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although you can come up with an incredible array of different names, there are some rules you must follow:\n",
      "Names must begin with a letter, an underscore, or a backslash.\n",
      "After the first character, names can contain letters, numbers, periods, and underscores.\n",
      "Names cannot contain spaces.\n",
      "Names cannot be the same as a cell or a range reference. For example, you cannot use $A$1 as a name.\n",
      "Names have a defined scope, either to a worksheet or a workbook, and must be unique within that scope.\n",
      "Names can contain up to 255 total characters.\n",
      "Excel does not recognize casing differences for names. So, within the same scope, you cannot, for example, create both SalesTotals and salestotals as names.\n",
      "You can use a single letter as a name, but you cannot do so by using either C or R in either uppercase or lowercase, as these are used as shorthand for selecting an entire row or an entire column in other Excel features.\n",
      "\n",
      "Names and the Name Box\n",
      "There are several methods you can use to create names in Excel 2010. The most direct of these is to use the Name Box. To name a cell or a range, you can simply select the desired cell or range and then type the desired name in the Name Box. Once you've created named cells and ranges, you can access those cells and ranges from the Name Box drop-down menu. This is a quick way to select a cell or range that you've already named. Additionally, if you manually select a named cell or range on a worksheet, the name, not the cell reference, is displayed in the Name Box. Names created in the Name Box, by default, have \"Workbook\" as their scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 1-2: Named ranges in the Name Box.\n",
      "\n",
      "The New Name Dialog Box\n",
      "You can also name cells or ranges by using the New Name dialog box. The advantage here is that you have greater control over configuring precisely what the name refers to. You can access the New Name dialog box by selecting Formulas→Defined Names→Define Name.\n",

      "Name field\tEnter a name for the cell or range.\n",
      "Scope drop-down menu\tAssign a scope to the name. This can be either the entire\n",
      "workbook or a particular worksheet. You cannot create two identical names within the same scope. You can, however, create identical names for both a worksheet and the workbook containing that worksheet. On the worksheet, the name that has the worksheet as its scope will take precedence. On all other worksheets, the name that has the workbook as its scope will take precedence.\n",
      "Comment field\tEnter a brief description of the named cell or range to help\n",
      "clarify its purpose.\n",
      "Refers to field\tView or edit the name's reference. Whatever cell or range is selected when you open the New Name dialog box will be displayed as an absolute reference in the Refers to field by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Create from Selection Command\n",
      "Another method you can use to name ranges is the Create from Selection command. This command enables you to quickly and easily create a single range name or multiple range names at once, based on the range you currently have selected. The Create from Selection command does not work for naming individual cells. By default, named ranges you create by using this command have \"Workbook\" as their scope.\n",
      "When you select a range and then select the Create from Selection command, Excel opens the Create Names from Selection dialog box, which allows you to select the cells from which Excel will create the names. This feature works best for ranges with clearly defined content types and appropriately labeled row and column headers. You may get unexpected results or error messages if headers don't align with Excel's naming conventions. If you use the Create from Selection command when a range in a single row or column in selected, Excel will create a single named range. If a range that covers multiple rows and columns is selected, Excel will create a series of named ranges based on the cell selection and the option you check in the Create Names from Selection dialog box. The cells from which Excel creates the names are not included in the range reference for the named ranges. The Create from Selection command is available in the Defined\n",

      "\n",
      "The Name Manager Dialog Box\n",
      "As most workbooks are dynamic, changing documents, it stands to reason that you will likely have to edit named cells and ranges from time to time. For example, if you need to add rows to a range of data, you will likely want named column ranges within that range of data to include the new rows.\n",
      "Excel 2010 provides the Name Manager dialog box, a tool you can use to view and manage all of the named objects in your workbooks. From here, you can rename, edit, and delete existing named objects, and access the New Name dialog box to create new named cells or ranges. You cannot, however, change the scope of an existing cell or range name by using the Name Manager dialog box. To do this, you can delete the existing name and create a new one with the desired scope. The Name Manager dialog box also displays a Filter command, which you can use to filter the display of existing names. Use the Filter command, for example, to view only those names that have the entire workbook as their scope, names that have a particular worksheet as their scope, or names containing errors. You can access the Name Manager dialog box by selecting Formulas→Defined Names→Name Manager.\n",

      "Although it's certainly helpful to be able to name a range or a cell for easy navigation, the real power of this feature lies in the ability to easily identify references in formulas and to quickly and accurately insert references into multiple formulas. Once you've defined a name, you can simply use the name in place of a standard cell or range reference in any formula or function.\n",

      "Figure 1-6: Named cells and ranges make it easier to identify the purpose of formulas and to enter cell and range references more accurately.\n",
      "As with many of the features and functions in Office applications, Excel provides several ways to perform a task. Such a task, in Excel, is inserting cell and range names in formulas and functions. The most common of these many methods are manually typing the name in a formula or function, using the Use in Formula command, and using the Formula AutoComplete feature. Let's look at each of these in some detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manually Entering Cell or Range Names\n",
      "The most direct method for including cell or range names instead of references in formulas or functions is to simply type them. Wherever you would normally enter a cell or range reference, you can type a defined name instead. The formula will reference the cell or range by name just as it would if you typed the cell or range reference, and your calculation results will be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also manually select a cell or range that you've applied a name to directly on a worksheet to enter it into a formula just as you would with any unnamed range or cell. When you do this, Excel automatically displays the name, not the reference, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Use in Formula Command Method\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes a ribbon command you can use to insert cell and range names into formulas and functions: the Use in Formula command. As with manually typing a cell or a range name, you can use this method anywhere you would normally enter a range or cell reference in a formula.\n",

      "Figure 1-7: The Use in Formula command displays all valid defined names for use in formulas and functions.\n",

      "The Formula AutoComplete Method\n",
      "You already know the Formula AutoComplete feature can help you enter functions into worksheet cells without having to type the full function name. Well, the Formula AutoComplete feature can also help you enter range and cell names into formulas and functions, and it works in the exact same way. As you type a formula or a function into a cell, whether directly into the cell or by using the Formula Bar, and you begin to type a cell or range name, the Formula AutoComplete feature automatically opens the same pop-up menu that appears when you type a function name. You can select any valid named cells or ranges from the pop-up menu to enter into the formula or function. The pop-up menu automatically filters the available defined names just as it would Excel functions. You can differentiate between functions and defined names in the Formula AutoComplete feature\n",

In the function's syntax, here are the required arguments: rate is the loan's fixed interest rate, nper is the total number of payments for the loan (for example, monthly payments for a three-year loan occur 36 times), pv is the present value (principal) of the loan. There are two optional arguments for the function: fv (future value of the loan) and type. The fv argument is used to indicate the remaining balance on the loan at the end of the specified period. Typically, this will be zero (meaning the loan is fully paid off), which is the value if you omit this argument. If you want to calculate the payments to partially pay off the loan, use the fv argument to indicate how much should be left over once all of the payments are made. The type argument indicates whether the payment is due at the end of each payment period (indicated by a zero or by omitting the argument), or at the beginning of each pay period (indicated by a 1).\n",

      "Automatic Workbook Calculation Considerations\n",
      "By default, Excel 2010 automatically recalculates the values returned by a formula or function if the data feeding the formula or function changes. In numerous cases, this functionality is preferred by many users. However, in large workbooks, with thousands of rows or columns of data and a large number of interdependent formulas, automatic recalculation can take anywhere from a few seconds to more than a minute. If you need to update multiple values in such a workbook, the automatic calculation functionality can actually hinder your efforts; while Excel is recalculating, you are unable to work in your worksheets. In these cases, you may want to temporarily disable automatic workbook calculations, revise the necessary data, and then update the workbook calculations. You can also choose to keep automatic workbook calculations turned off and manually update calculations by using the Calculate Now command when updates are necessary.\n",

      "Apply data validation.\n",
      "Work with forms and form controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Let's face it: working with large workbooks presents a number of challenges. Entering large amounts of data can be time consuming and it's prone to errors. You may also find yourself spending a lot of time and effort performing the same few tasks over and over again. And, the more people who work in the same workbook, the more these types of issues become magnified. In short, as you develop ever larger and more complex workbooks, you'll want to find ways to automate any number of tasks to save time, reduce errors, and generally make using your workbooks easier.\n",
      "The good news is that Microsoft® Excel® 2010 includes a variety of features that allow you to do just that. From ensuring that only the correct data or type of data can be entered into your worksheets to performing repetitive task so you don't have to, Excel's automation features can save you valuable time and keep your data intact.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Apply Data Validation\n",
      "The single most important aspect of data analysis is having accurate data to analyze. Given the large number of people who may use your workbooks, it's essential that you be able to trust the data they enter. Only a few bad entries can have a chain-reaction-like effect on formulas and tables throughout large workbooks. What can you do, short of standing over someone's shoulder as he or she enters data, to ensure your massive amounts of data are valid? This seems a near-impossible task to achieve.\n",
      "Excel provides you with a robust and flexible way to make sure only valid data is entered into your worksheets: data validation. Understanding precisely what Excel enables you to control, and how to configure your worksheets to accept only correct entries, will allow you to take control of your worksheets and rest assured that you're avoiding major data errors that could take endless hours to locate and resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Validation\n",
      "In Excel, you use data validation to restrict data entries in worksheet cells. You can use data validation, for example, to limit cell entries to values above, below, or between particular thresholds; to only positive values; to only date values; or even to one of a selection of options from a drop- down menu. Data validation helps to ensure that your worksheet users cannot enter data that would cause unwanted results by enabling you to define restrictions on the data they enter. Data that does not meet the requirements of data validation is known as invalid data.\n",
      "It is important to keep a few things in mind when applying data validation to your workbooks. First, data validation does not work on data that is copied and pasted or dragged to a cell; it works only on data that is manually entered. In fact, copying data to a cell to which you have applied data validation may clear the data validation from the cell. Additionally, although you can apply data validation to cells that already contain data, Excel will not notify you about nor change any existing data that does not meet the specified data validation criteria. Keep in mind that data validation is best suited for preventing erroneous data entries, and not malicious attempts to corrupt data. Use cell protection to prevent users from purposely entering bad data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Data Validation Dialog Box\n",
      "You will use the Data Validation dialog box to apply validation to worksheet cells and to manage existing data validation criteria. The Data Validation dialog box is divided into three tabs: the Settings, Input Message, and Error Alert tabs, which provide you with access to the commands and functions you will use to create and manage data validation and data validation messages. You can access the Data Validation dialog box by selecting Data→Data Tools→Data Validation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Data Validation Criteria\n",
      "Excel provides you with a variety of criteria you can use to control what users can enter into worksheet cells. By default, you can enter any value into any cell on a worksheet. Excel provides you with six other types of data validation criteria that you can apply to worksheet cells. You can also customize your data validation criteria by using a formula. The particular options available on the Settings tab change depending on the type of criteria you select from the Allow drop-down menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 2-2: Excel provides various options for configuring data validation based on the selected criteria type.\n",

      "\n",
      "Any value\tThis is the default setting for worksheet cells. It enables users to enter any type of data in cells.\n",
      "Whole number\tThis criteria type allows users to enter only whole numbers that meet the specified conditions, which are based on logical operators. So, for example, you can allow users to enter only whole numbers greater than 50, between 13 and 57, or less than or equal to 1,000.\n",
      "Decimal\tThis criteria type is nearly identical to the whole number criteria type. The only exception is that it allows for values containing decimals.\n",
      "List\tThis criteria type enables you to set a pre-determined list of options as the only valid data for the cells. You can either enter the list of options directly into the Data Validation dialog box, or reference a range of cells that contain the valid data. This criteria type also enables you to provide users with in-cell drop-down menus they can use to enter the data. You can also opt to allow them to manually enter the list items.\n",
      "Date\tThis criteria type is similar to both the whole number and the decimal criteria types, but it allows users to enter only date values.\n",
      "Time\tThis is the same as the date criteria type with the exception that it restricts data entries to time values.\n",
      "Text length\tThis criteria type allows users to enter only values that contain a specified number of characters. The text criteria type does not limit values to only text values, you can also enter numeric or other values as long as they contain the specified number of characters.\n",
      "Custom\tThis criteria type enables you to customize your data validation by using formulas to limit data entries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the options that Excel displays in the Data Validation dialog box change depending on the criteria type selected, there are two options that always appear. The first of these is the Ignore blank check box. Although this check box is always available, it pertains only to criteria that is based on references to a data range; this is common when creating a list, for example. If the Ignore blank check box is checked and the source criteria (range) contains blank cells, then users are able to enter any value into the cells with data validation. If the ignore blank check box is not checked, users will receive whatever error you specified for the data validation if they try to enter a value not contained in the source criteria.\n",
      "The other option that is always available is the Apply these changes to all other cells with the same settings check box. This check box pertains only to editing data validation. If you have a range of cells to which you've applied the same data validation, and you select only one of those cells for the purpose of editing the data validation criteria, this check box determines whether or not the changes will affect all of the other cells with the same data validation applied to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input Messages and Error Alerts\n",
      "In addition to specifying which types of data users can enter into worksheet cells, Excel provides you with options for prompting users with messages and warnings regarding data validation. You will use the commands and options on the Input Message and Error Alert tabs in the Data Validation dialog box to create and manage these messages. Input messages serve to provide the user with instructional text on what type of data they can enter into the cell. Setting input messages does not restrict the user from being able to enter invalid data; they simply display whatever message you specify. Input messages appear in a pop-up window that opens when users select cells containing data validation that have input messages enabled.\n",

      "\n",
      "Stop\tThe Stop error alert restricts users from entering any invalid data.\n",
      "When Excel displays Stop error alerts, the user has only two options: to cancel or to retry the entry.\n",

You want to keep as much control as possible over data integrity, so you decide to take some steps to make sure other users will be able to enter only valid data in the workbook, and that the process of adding new authors and updating data is as simple and efficient as possible.\n",
      "You decide to start by applying data validation to some of the columns to ensure that your staff can enter only appropriate values in them. As some of the entries on the author roster come from a predetermined set of values, you decide to add drop-down menus to prevent errors caused by typos.

You think it would be a good idea to apply data validation to cells in the additional rows as well to further accommodate future entries.\n",

      "People use Excel worksheets for a variety of reasons. Some workbooks simply keep track of lists of information or help users track progress for projects or organizational initiatives. Other workbooks contain thousands of data entries linked by a complex series of functions and formulas. Whatever the user's purpose for the workbook, all workbooks have one thing in common: They all contain data. This means that someone has to enter that data. Although data entry in Excel worksheets is typically fairly straightforward, some worksheets require excessive scrolling for users to be able to access all cells. Other worksheets may require users to enter data that is difficult to type, such as technical jargon or complex numeric figures. Whatever the reason, you may find yourself in charge of a workbook that some users find difficult to work with. So, it would be helpful if you could include or take advantage of functionality to help those users complete the task at hand.\n",
      "Fortunately, Excel 2010 provides you with a number of options for helping users enter data. Whether for saving them the time and effort it takes to navigate around large worksheets or for providing quick and easy access to the data they need to supply, your workbook users will thank you for taking the time to include this additional functionality. And you'll enjoy the benefits of managing workbooks that aren't full of errors and getting the data you need from your colleagues quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forms\n",
      "Making it easy for users to add data to Excel worksheets typically involves working with some type of form. A form is either a physical or an electronic document that is organized for the purpose of collecting information. You are likely familiar with all manner of forms, such as those you might fill out at a doctor's office, when applying for a job, or when ordering items from a printed catalog. An electronic form is much the same as a physical form, except it exists as an electronic document, not on printed paper, and may contain additional functionality, such as buttons and interactive menus, that can help you fill in the required information.\n",
      "Although Excel spreadsheets are often used for storing and analyzing organizational data, they contain a fair amount of built-in functionality that also makes them suitable for creating electronic forms. For example, you can create forms that new hires might use to enter their personal and employee information. Because they would be entering that information directly into Excel, you could then take advantage of Excel's organizational and analytical capabilities to work with the information without first having to perform data entry. You can use these same capabilities to simply make entering data easier for other, more typical, workbook uses.\n",

      "\n",
      "Data forms\tA data form makes entering data into worksheets that contain a large number of columns quick and easy. Excel automatically creates these forms for you based on the column labels in your dataset. The main advantage of using data forms is the fact that you don't have to scroll horizontally to enter data all the way at the end of long rows. But data forms also allow users to easily search for a particular entry (row) of data, view all column headers in a single window, and take advantage of simple tabbed navigation. You must add the Form control to the Quick Access Toolbar or the ribbon to generate data forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Worksheets with form controls\n",
      "\n",
      "Worksheets made into forms closely resemble the physical paper forms you have likely filled out on many occasions. They are predominantly used to gather information.

Additionally, you can include form controls that make it easier for the user to add particular information.\n",
      "\n",
      "VBA UserForms\tVBA UserForms are highly customized dialog boxes that can be used to enter information or data on worksheets. However, UserForms are not limited to this task. You can create UserForms to help you perform a wide variety of tasks, and they can be used in any Office application that supports apps created in Microsoft's Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language.

      "Controls are objects you can add to your worksheets that help users perform certain tasks, such as entering data or making a selection in a cell linked to the control. In Excel, there are two types of controls: form controls and ActiveX controls. Form controls provide you with an easy way to add functionality to your worksheets without having to use VBA code. Form controls are compatible with earlier version of Excel, dating back to Excel 5.0, but cannot be used on VBA UserForms. In addition to helping users make selections or enter content into worksheets, you can configure form controls to run either existing or new macros. To access the form controls you can add to your worksheets, select Developer→Controls→Insert.\n",

      "combo box is similar to the standard list box form control. But with combo boxes, the list box is minimized until the user selects the down arrow. Combo boxes return the index value of the selected item in the linked cell, so you can use them in combination with the INDEX function to return the selected item in any cell other than the linked cell.\n",
      "Check box\t                Check boxes typically return a logical value of either TRUE or FALSE in the linked cell. This means you can use them in combination with logical functions to add functionality to your worksheets. A checked check box returns the value TRUE, whereas an unchecked check box returns the value FALSE. There is a third possible state for check boxes: mixed. A check box in the mixed state appears shaded and returns a value of #N/A. An example of a check box that might appear in this state is a \"select all\" check box for a group of other check boxes. If some of those check boxes are checked and some not, the \"select all\" check box will be in the mixed state. Users can check more than one check box at a time on a worksheet or within a group box.\n",
      "Spin button\t                Spin boxes allow users to increase or decrease the value in the linked cell by a specified increment. You can set the minimum and maximum values, and the incremental value to suit your needs. Users are also typically able to manually enter values in the linked cell.\n",
      "Because spin buttons return numeric values, you can use the returned value in most formulas and functions.\n",
      "List box\tList boxes return the index value of the selected item in the linked cell. Unlike combo boxes, list boxes always appear full size so they can take up a lot of space. Use list boxes in combination with the INDEX function to return the selected item in any cell other than the linked cell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option button\n",
      "\n",
      "These form controls are commonly referred to as radio buttons. Unlike check boxes, users can select only one radio button within the same worksheet or group box at a time. Radio buttons that are not grouped together in a group box will all be considered as part of the same selection. Radio buttons in a group box represent a single collection of radio buttons, meaning they represent a single decision point. For each collection of radio buttons, the selected radio button returns the index value of its place in the collection in the linked cell. So, like with other form controls, you can use the INDEX function in combination with these to return the desired option in any cell but the linked cell.\n",

Even the most well-designed and complex workbooks are useless if you can't trust the data they contain and if users simply can't or don't want to use them. By taking advantage of Excel's automation functionality, you'll be able to relax knowing the analysis you generate from your workbooks provides sound organizational intelligence. Your workbook users just may thank you for making it easy for them to provide you with the information you need.\n",

      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Microsoft® Excel®'s formulas and functions provide you with a robust set of options for performing complex calculations on the data in your workbooks. But on their own, they may not always perform the precise calculations you need them to. For example, you may need a function to reference a value from another dataset based on some particular criteria. But, how do you tell the function how to look that up? Or perhaps you need one of your arguments to be the result of another formula or function. Although you could always enter that formula or function in another cell and then simply include a reference to that cell as an argument in the original function, this could quickly take up a lot of real estate on your worksheet, which isn't always desirable.\n",
      "Excel provides options for dealing with these and many other situations. But doing so requires an understanding of a new set of Excel functions, Lookup functions, and a deeper understanding of function syntax. By investing the time it takes to elevate your understanding of how these functions work and how they work together, you'll begin to develop the ability to create incredibly complex functions and formulas that can perform any number of calculations. In short, you'll begin to understand how to, essentially, program Excel to perform tasks that you can't use the built-in functions to perform.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Use Lookup Functions\n",
      "So, you've collected a massive amount of data about your operations, upon which you can perform an amazing variety of analysis. But what if you want quick access to just a particular bit of data? In some cases, you may be able to search for it. But suppose you don't know what the value is. For example, what if you need to find out who employee 1287's manager is or in which region he or she works? If you don't know the answer you're looking for, you don't know what search criteria to enter. Or perhaps you need to enter the total number of units sold for a particular product into a formula. Although you could search for the product and look up the value yourself, you wouldn't want to do this for multiple products over and over.\n",
      "Fortunately, Excel 2010 enables you to look up such values, even in massive datasets, with relative ease. By using a set of functions known as Lookup functions, you'll be able to look up or include in a formula any one particular entry in any dataset. This level of functionality can quickly give you a detailed view of how any one individual value contributes to the overall operation of your organization. This can help you make clear, informed decisions that affect large-scale operations based on just a single chunk of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lookup Functions\n",
      "In Excel, Lookup functions do exactly what you'd think they would: They look up some value. Specifically, Lookup functions search through a particular dataset to return a particular value based on some criteria. Take a look at this simple example of how you might use a Lookup function.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the Lookup function is looking up employee 1004's salary. A lookup function can identify the range A2:E11, search down column A until it finds 1004, and then look across the row to the Salary column to return the result $76,000. Lookup functions can perform other tasks as well. For example, they can look across a row to find the lookup value, and then count down rows to return another value. They can return a value in the equivalent location as another value in separate ranges. Or, they can return a value's place in a range.\n",
      "The particular Lookup function in the given example, which is in cell B14, references cell B13. So, for any employee ID a user enters, the function will return the salary. And, to add another level of\n",

      "\n",
      "Lesson 3: Applying Conditional Logic | Topic A\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "functionality, you could add a data validation drop-down list in cell B13 to create a dashboard tool that looks up the salary for any selected ID. Now, take this one step further and assume cell B14 is an argument in another function that performs some calculation based on the returned salary, say the employee's bonus for the year. It's easy to see how quickly a simple Lookup function can add complexity and functionality that produces valuable results.\n",
      "As is the case with all Excel functions, the key to leveraging Lookup functions is understanding function syntax. Let's take a look at the syntax for some of the most commonly used Lookup functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The VLOOKUP Function\n",
      "Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])\n",
      "Description: You can use the VLOOKUP function to search down the first column of a dataset to find a specified value and then return any value in any column in the row that contains the specified value. Here is a description of the function's arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "lookup_value\tThis is the value the function will search for in the first column of the specified dataset. The lookup_value argument can either be a hard- coded value or a reference to the value in another cell.\n",
      "table_array\tThis argument specifies the dataset the VLOOKUP function searches.\n",
      "This argument can be a range reference, a defined name, or an array constant.\n",
      "col_index_num\tThis argument is a positive whole number that specifies the column number from the dataset that the function will return a value from. If you enter 3, the function returns the value in the third column of the same row as the lookup value. If you enter a 4, it returns the value from the cell in the fourth column of the same row. Note that if you enter 1 for this argument, the function will return the lookup value itself as that is the value in the first column of the specified dataset.\n",
      "[range_lookup]\tThis is an optional argument that determines whether the function looks for an exact match of the lookup value or an approximate equivalent. If you enter the value FALSE for this argument, the function will look for only exact matches. If you omit this argument or enter a value of TRUE, the function will look for either an exact match or an approximate match. An approximate match is the largest value that is less than the value of the lookup value. If the [range-lookup] argument is FALSE, the values in the first column (the one containing the lookup value) do not need to be sorted. In all other cases, they must be sorted in ascending order.\n",

      "Combine Functions\n",
      "Excel functions and formulas provide you with an incredible array of options for performing calculations on your worksheets. But, as you may have already noticed, they aren't always exactly what you need, and sometimes, they just aren't capable of performing the task you want them to. For example, you know how to use an IF function to produce two different results based on a logical test. But, what if you want to include more than one logical test? What if there are a dozen or more? Or, suppose you need to use the values returned by several different functions as arguments in another function.\n",
      "These may at first seem like difficult challenges to overcome. You may think you need to use a variety of functions in a variety of cells, and then include references to the results in other formulas to pull this off. But that's not really the case. Excel 2010 has the capability to consider multiple functions or calculations simultaneously, and to do so within just a single cell. Once you begin to understand one simple concept, you'll be able to start cobbling together highly complex functions and formulas that can perform a sophisticated, powerful set of calculations based on a wide variety of criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nesting\n",
      "The key to combining multiple calculations into a function in a single cell is nesting. Nesting is, simply, using a function as an argument within another function. Whatever value the nested function returns becomes the value the main function uses for the argument. This works much like including a reference to the value in a cell in a formula or function. Nesting enables you to craft highly complex functions that perform a wide variety of calculations or perform multiple logical tests in order to achieve a single result in a single cell.\n",
      "Excel enables you to nest more than one function within the same larger function, and you can nest functions within nested functions. In fact, Excel 2010 supports up to 64 levels of nesting. A function nested within another function is referred to as a second-level function. A function nested within the nested function is called a third-level function, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 3-1: Nesting enables you to use the value returned by one function as an argument in another function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nested Function Syntax\n",
      "As is the case with all other Excel functions, the key to understanding nested functions is understanding nested function syntax. Because the particular syntax of any one nested function depends on the particular syntax of the first-level function and all of the other functions you wish to\n",

      "\n",
      "Lesson 3: Applying Conditional Logic | Topic B\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "nest, this section will mainly focus on presenting a couple of examples of nested functions and then breaking down the syntax into chunks to examine the specific calculation.\n",
      "Before looking at a few examples, however, there are some important points to keep in mind regarding nested functions:\n",
      "Any function used as an argument must return a value of the same data type as the argument.\n",
      "You do not include the equal sign ( = ) before a nested function, but all remaining function syntax is the same as it usually is for the function. You still must include the equal sign before the first-level function.\n",
      "Each function, both the first-level function and all nested functions, must have a complete set of parentheses. These can become tricky to track, but they must all be present.\n",
      "Now, let's take a look at two examples.\n",
      "In this first example, the user is trying to determine if members of a group of sales reps qualify for a bonus. The bonus is based on meeting two criteria: having sales greater than $3,000 and having sold more than 2,000 units of product. It's easy to use an IF function to determine whether or not someone qualifies for a bonus based on a single criteria, but what about two criteria? For this, you'll need to nest an AND function within an IF function.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the AND function is being used as the logical_test argument in the IF function. So the logical test includes both conditions stipulated by the AND function. As Allen has met only one of the conditions set out in the AND function, the IF function returns a value of FALSE. Remember that the logical_test argument can be either a logical test or a logical value. As the argument evaluates to the logical value FALSE, the IF function returns the value_if_false value, which in this case is \"No Bonus.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this second example, the user is calculating commission payments for a group of sales reps. But the particular commission rate depends on the sales volume generated by each rep. If the rep's sales are less than $2,000, he or she receives a 5-percent commission. If sales are between $2,000 and\n",
      "$4,999, the commission rate is 7 percent. If sales are $5,000 or more, the rep receives a 9-percent commission. If this were only a matter of two different rates, a simple IF function would suffice. But how do you add the second logical test? You nest one IF function within another.\n",

      "Lesson 3: Applying Conditional Logic | Topic B\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down the function's syntax. If this had been a case of applying one of two commission rates, say either 5 or 7 percent, the function could have looked like this:\n",
      "=IF(B2<2000, B2*0.05, B2*0.07)\n",
      "But there is a third condition. Instead of telling Excel to multiply any value greater than $2,000 by a single value, you have to specify a second logical test. This second logical test, on its own, would typically look something like this:\n",
      "=IF(B2<5000, B2*0.07, B2*0.09)\n",
      "This function should be included as the third argument in the original function, without the leading equal sign, to get this:\n",
      "=IF(B2<2000, B2*0.05, IF(B2<5000, B2*0.07, B2*0.09))\n",
      "If you were to read this function aloud, it would sound something like, \"If the value in cell B2 is less than 2,000, then multiply it by 5 percent; if the value is less than 5,000, multiply it by 7 percent; otherwise, multiply it by 9 percent.\" You do not need to include a logical argument for the value being greater than or equal to 5,000 as the first two logical arguments already include all values that don't match that description.\n",
      "It is easy to see how nesting can quickly become highly complex. If you break the first-level function and all nested functions down into chunks and carefully think about what each function's syntax is asking Excel to do, you can read or write nearly any combination of nested functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guidelines for Combining Functions\n",
      "\n",
      "As long as you understand the syntax of all functions you wish to nest, you can combine up to seven levels of functions within a single first-level function. You must also carefully follow these guidelines:\n",
      "To nest a function within another, include the nested function as an argument in the first-level function. Subsequent lower-level functions can be nested within the nested function(s).\n",
      "You must include the equal sign ( = ) for the first-level function.\n",
      "Do not include an equal sign for any of the nested functions. The rest of the syntax for all nested functions remains the same.\n",
      "All functions, nested or otherwise, must include a full set of parentheses.\n",
      "Higher-level functions ignore the commas within the parentheses of nested functions. Those commas separate only the arguments for the associated function.\n",
      "Any function used as an argument must return a value of the same data type as the argument.\n",
      "You can combine nested functions and other calculations within a single argument. For example, an argument that needs to be a numeric value can be made up of a function multiplied by a constant or by the value in a cell.\n",

You realize you will need to use nested functions to achieve this functionality. One item of particular importance is a new author bonus initiative you started. As a one-time reward for authors whose work consistently generates significant income, Fuller and Ackerman will pay authors their royalty rate times their average income per title. Because you already have a dashboard function that looks up income per title, you decide to link that result to the function that calculates the bonus royalty for all qualifying authors. The threshold Fuller and Ackerman management has set for your bonus program is $500,000 in income per title.\n",

      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Microsoft® Excel® 2010 provides you with a powerful array of functionality for organizing and analyzing your data. As you become more familiar with these features, you'll find you can ask Excel an astonishingly vast array of questions and get the answers you need. But not everyone who you report to or present data to will have the same comfort level or expertise when it comes to viewing worksheets. Viewing information in the form of ranges of data entries is simply not natural for many people. You may find yourself presenting information to large audiences on a regular basis. In these cases, you don't want people scanning lines of data on a worksheet when you're trying to present. You want to give them a simple, easy-to- digest view of important data so they can quickly understand what's really important.\n",
      "In short, you need a way to generate visual representations of your data. Excel 2010 includes some handy functionality that can convert your raw or analyzed data into visually clear, easy- to-interpret diagrams with just a few steps. Taking the time to understand how this functionality works will give you the ability to generate high-impact visuals to quickly present to nearly any audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Create Charts\n",
      "Let's face it, long strings of data are simply difficult for people to read and interpret. And, in today's fast-paced, data-driven world, most people don't have the time to sit down and pore over worksheets to get the information they need. Often, decision makers are looking for only a snapshot of just the most relevant information. And, as an Excel user, it's likely your job to provide that snapshot for them.\n",
      "Now that you've amassed, organized, and analyzed your data, you need to convert all of the figures and labels into a picture that makes a clear, simple statement. The good news is that, in Excel, this is quite simple to do. And, what's even better is once you convert your data in to easy-to-view visuals, you can keep those visuals up to date just as easily as you can your data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charts\n",
      "Charts are graphical representations of the numeric values and relationships in a dataset. Charts help worksheet viewers to quickly and easily interpret the data in a worksheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 4-1: A pie chart on an Excel worksheet.\n",
      "In this figure, while you can tell from the values in the Total Sales (in billions) column what the sales are for each market, the pie chart to the right of the data is much easier to interpret. With just a glance, you can tell that North American sales account for more sales than the other three regions, and that they account for more than a third of all sales. Getting this information from the raw data would require a bit of analysis and some calculating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chart Basics\n",
      "Although there is a wide variety of charts available in Excel 2010 to chart a number of different types of data, most of the chart types follow the same basic conventions. Most of the commonly used chart types in Excel plot data along two axes, the X axis and the Y axis. The X axis is the one that runs horizontally along the chart. It is typically used to represent a category of information, such as fiscal quarter or department. The Y, or vertical, axis is typically used to represent values within your dataset, such as sales totals or number of products shipped. The objects displayed in the chart, such as bars, columns, or lines, typically represent the individual items, or series, for which you wish to represent the data, such as particular regions or individual sales reps.\n",

      "\n",
      "Lesson 4: Visualizing Data with Basic Charts | Topic A\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Excel pulls data from your worksheets to create charts, it's important to understand how Excel reads your data to create them. Excel pulls the elements plotted along the X axis, or the categories, from your column labels. It identifies a data series based on the row labels from the selected dataset. Excel reads the values in the remaining cells as the values to plot against the Y axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 4-2: Using simple sales data to chart relative sales by region.\n",
      "Note that, in the figure, the categories along the X axis correspond to the worksheet column labels, which in this case are fiscal quarters. The data series, represented by the columns on the chart, represent different global regions, which Excel pulled from the row labels. The data entered into the remaining cells are the values against which the series are plotted.\n",
      "Of course, not all charts work exactly like this, but most of the commonly used charts do. The most notable exceptions are the pie chart, which you will typically use only to chart a single column of data, and the bar chart, which essentially turns a column chart on its side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chart Types\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes 11 different chart types, each of which is ideal for displaying a particular type of data or set of relationships. Each type of chart contains a variety of specific sub-types that you can use to tailor the presentation of your data. You can access the chart types and sub-types in the Insert Chart dialog box, which you can use to insert charts in your worksheets. You can access the Insert Chart dialog box by selecting the Insert→Charts dialog box launcher, or by selecting All Chart Types from any of the chart type drop-down menus in the Charts group on the Insert tab.\n",

This does not always generate the desired outcome, so it's a best practice to manually select the desired dataset.\n",
      "It's important to remember to include row and column labels in your selection and to have your data entered correctly. For example, the categories you want plotted along the X axis should be your column labels, and the desired data series should be the row labels. Once you have ensured that your data is properly entered on the worksheet, and you have selected the desired range, you have three general options for inserting a chart: ribbon commands, the Insert Chart dialog box, or inserting the default chart type. For either of the first two methods, simply select the desired chart type from the Insert Chart dialog box or from the chart type drop-down menus in the Charts group on the Insert tab.\n",
      "If you know you will be inserting a number of the same type of chart in your workbook, you can set that chart type as the default chart type. Then you can use one of two keyboard shortcuts to instantly create the default chart type out of any selected dataset.\n",

A report contains data for reading or viewing can be simple or complex, and enables the reader to apply her own judgment and analysis to the data being presented.

      "Although you can create charts with just a few mouse clicks, the default chart configurations aren't always exactly what you need to present your data. Depending on your audience and the venue, you may want to include more or less information than the default configurations include, present your data with organizational branding, or simply make your charts larger or easier to read.\n",
      "Excel 2010 provides you with a vast array of options when it comes to modifying and formatting your charts.

A well-formatted chart can mean the difference between simply delivering information and making an impact on your audience.\n",

      "Modification vs. Formatting\n",
      "Modifying and formatting charts go hand-in-hand. Although many people use these terms synonymously, they are actually two different things. Modifying a chart includes making changes such as moving chart elements, adding or removing chart elements, turning the display of particular data on or off, and changing the chart type.

While all Excel charts contain at least one chart element, by default, the various chart types display different chart elements. For example, while bar and column charts typically display an X and a Y axis, surface charts display three axes. Pie and doughnut charts don't contain axes as they deal with only a single column of data. Each chart element serves a different role in visually communicating information about data and trends.\n",

      "Formatting charts has relatively little impact on an audience's ability to interpret your data. Modifying chart elements, on the other hand, can have a significant impact. As a general rule, it's best to include only those chart elements that are absolutely necessary for conveying meaning.\n",
      "Cluttered charts can muddy your main point and make the chart confusing to view, which is exactly what you create charts to avoid. However, some chart elements do actually help add meaning. Until you gain an intuitive sense of what chart elements to include for various purposes, you may want to consider adding chart elements that you feel will help your target audience interpret your data and analyze your chart, and then remove anything that doesn't directly contribute to the message you intend to deliver. When analyzing your charts, ask yourself questions, such as:\n",
      "If I remove the gridlines, will the chart still convey meaning?\n",
      "Do I need a legend? Can I remove the legend and use data labels instead?\n",
      "How much precision do I need for axis labels?\n",
      "Do the axes really need titles?\n",
      "Will using a three-dimensional layout enhance visual appeal or distort proportions?\n",
      "Does including the data table aid understanding?\n",
      "Do I really need major and minor tick marks on the axes?\n",

      "\n",
      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "Often, images can tell a story or provide insight in an instantaneous fashion that isn't always possible with words and numbers. When presenting complex relationships among various bits of data to large groups of people, you may often find it easier to display a chart or a graph instead of asking the audience to pore over massive amounts of data to see your point. Data and relationships can be complex, and the basic charts in Microsoft® Excel® aren't always sufficient for displaying such complexity. For example, you may wish to display a variety of relationships within a single chart or you may want to graphically display how values relate to each other for massive datasets with far too many entries to reasonably display on a chart. In these cases, you'll need to go beyond creating simple pie or column charts to get the right message across.\n",
      "Fortunately, Excel's capabilities for graphically presenting data go well beyond the use of simple chart types. Investing a bit of time now to fully understand what these capabilities are and what they can do will give you the ability to make visual sense of your complex data for nearly any type of presentation or delivery situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Use Advanced Chart Features\n",
      "Have you ever needed to graphically display two widely different sets of data simultaneously? For example, you may wish to show how unit sales correlate to overall sales totals within the same chart. It's likely that the figures for total sales are much higher than they are for the number of units sold; after all, many items cost far more than a dollar these days. Putting both figures on the same chart would likely make at least one of the data series difficult to read. Or suppose you want to display future projections for your datasets on the same chart you use to display the data itself. Without the future data, how can you create chart elements that visually convey the information you wish to share? What if you have to create a lot of these charts? Does all of this mean a lot of extra data entry, calculation, and formatting?\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes a wide range of advanced charting features that enable you to display widely varying sets of data together, include forecasting trends on your charts, and reuse highly stylized or formatted charts again and again. It almost goes without saying that this level of functionality means you can quickly make an impact on nearly any presentation without having to put a lot of time and effort into doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dual-Axis Charts\n",
      "A dual-axis chart is, simply, a chart that displays two sets of information on the same chart. This can be in the form of a dual-Y-axis chart, which displays two data series simultaneously, or a dual-X-axis chart, which displays two categories simultaneously. By far, dual-Y-axis charts are used far more frequently than dual-X-axis charts. But dual-X-axis charts can be useful for particular types of charts, such as bubble charts or XY (scatter) charts. Excel supports dual-axis charts only for 2-D chart types; they do not work with 3-D chart types. You can create a chart with a secondary X axis only if it already has a secondary Y axis.\n",
      "The main advantage to dual-axis charts is the ability to not only display two different sets of data simultaneously, but also to format the different sets of data independently of each other. This means you can make the two data series easily visually distinguishable from each other and display within the same amount of space using different scales. For example, you can simultaneously display unit sales figures, which may range in the thousands, with total sales figures, which could range in the billions of dollars for expensive equipment. Clearly, the data that is expressed in billions of units would be far easier to see within the same Y axis scale than the data with figures in the thousands. In fact, those figures may not even be visible with such a drastic difference in scale.\n",

      "Forecasting\n",
      "In addition to creating secondary axes to display various data series or categories simultaneously, Excel includes a chart feature that can help you forecast trends in your data. Forecasting is the process of using the trends that exist within past data to predict future outcomes. By its nature, forecasting can never be entirely accurate, as one can never precisely predict all possible future outcomes. As a general rule, the more you forecast out into the future, the less accurate your forecasts become.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trendlines\n",
      "In Excel, trendlines are chart elements that can graphically represent the current trends that exist within your data and past or future forecasts of those trends. You can add trendlines to any of the following non-stacked, 2-D chart types: column, line, bar, area, stock, XY (scatter), and bubble. You can name and format trendlines to make them easier to view on charts or to adhere to organizational branding standards. To access the options for adding trendlines to your charts, from the Chart Tools contextual tab, select Layout→Analysis→Trendline.\n",

      "Create Sparklines\n",
      "Although charts and trendlines can be convenient ways to graphically display data, trends, and relationships to worksheet viewers, they aren't always practical. For example, imagine presenting a chart that displays the sales trends for 2,000 sales reps throughout your organization. The chart would be so dense and cluttered, no one would be able to make sense of the information you're presenting. It would be nice to give your sales managers an easy way to visually identify trends for any of their reps with just a glance. By taking advantage of Excel's handy data visualization functionality in sparklines, you can combine the benefits of storing massive amounts of data on very large worksheets with the ability to discern important information and identify trends with just a glance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sparklines\n",
      "You can think of sparklines as a type of miniature chart that you can actually insert within worksheet cells. Unlike charts, shapes, images, or SmartArt graphics, sparklines are not objects that float above worksheet cells; they become the background image for the cells themselves. You can use sparklines to visually display relative values of cell data over time. Although you can insert sparklines into cells that contain text or data, it is often a good idea, for the sake of legibility, to insert them into empty cells near the data they represent.\n",
      "You can apply pre-formatted styles to sparklines, or customize them to suit your needs. And, you can change the sparkline type for existing sparklines just as you can change chart types. Sparklines can be grouped together so you can apply formatting to large numbers of sparklines simultaneously. As is the case with other cell content such as formulas and functions, you can copy sparklines down a range of data by using relative references to quickly populate large ranges with sparklines. When you create ranges of sparklines all at once or you use the fill handle to copy sparklines, Excel automatically groups them together. If you copy and paste sparklines to new cells, Excel does not automatically group them together. You can access the commands for inserting sparklines in the Sparklines group on the Insert tab.\n",

      "Create a PivotTable.\n",
      "Analyze PivotTable data.\n",
      "Present data with PivotCharts.\n",
      "Filter data by using slicers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lesson Introduction\n",
      "You've already seen the way Microsoft® Excel® functions and features can help you drill down into your data to get answers to very specific questions. Although using sorting and filtering is often a good option for attaining specific answers, these aren't necessarily the best options if you need to frequently change the questions you're asking of your data. To change the question you're asking when using functions, sorting, and filtering, you often need to rewrite functions, adjust criteria, or re-filter you data; sometimes, you need to use several of these methods at the same time. If you work in a high-paced, data-intensive environment, you simply may not have the time needed to recalculate every time a supervisor asks you a different question. You need something a little more dynamic.\n",
      "Excel 2010 includes a powerful feature that enables you to ask any number of questions of your data; get detailed, specific answers; and do it all over again in just a matter of moments. By using PivotTables to analyze your data, you can get critical, time-sensitive organizational intelligence to the people who need it quickly, easily, and with a high level of flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "TOPIC A\n",
      "Create a PivotTable\n",
      "To take advantage of the functionality and flexibility of PivotTables, you must first understand how to create them. Although this is a relatively simple process, you must also know a bit about the type of data that works best for PivotTables. By taking a few moments to gain this foundational level of understanding, you'll be preparing yourself to create useful, effective PivotTables that you can use to analyze your raw data in incredibly fine detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pivoting\n",
      "Pivoting allows you to view your data from a variety of new perspectives. In Excel, pivoting is a form of data manipulation that can take a column of data and pivot it into a row and vice versa. While this may not seem highly useful at first, think about it in terms of reorganizing and summarizing data based on a number of criteria. For example, let's say you have a dataset that contains rows of data, each representing a single event, such as a sale, a shipment, or a financial transaction. Each row would be composed of cells in a series of columns that each represent a single aspect of the individual events, say a particular date, dollar amount, or location. If you want to compile particular data about these events as a whole, say to find the total sales that occurred at each of the various locations, you could take the location column and pivot it so that it appears as a series of rows with each unique location being represented by an individual row. Location is your first criterion.\n",
      "Your second criterion is sales figures. In the original dataset, each row represents a single sale. The sales figures for all of the sales were in the same column, and each was associated with one of the locations. Now that the locations are represented by individual rows in the pivoted dataset, you want to know the total value of all sales from the dataset for each location. Manually calculating this would take some time; however, asking Excel to look at every sales entry for each location, sum the values together, and then return the total value for each location in the new rows would save all that manual effort. Once done, you would have just successfully pivoted a single column into multiple rows and summarized a particular data entry for each to answer a very specific question: how much in total sales was generated for each location? This simple example shows the power of pivoting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a look at how the previous example would work in a worksheet.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here, you can see that, in the original dataset, each sale is listed as a separate entry. Store locations, in the form of location codes, appear within a single column. In the pivoted dataset, that column has been pivoted into rows, with each location being represented by a single row. For each location, Excel has summed each sale and calculated the total sales per store. Excel also calculated the total of all sales for all locations.\n",
      "\n",
      "PivotTables\n",
      "A PivotTable is a dynamic Excel data object that enables you to analyze data by pivoting columns and rows of raw data without altering the raw data. PivotTables are effective for summarizing large volumes of data according to two or more criteria to return specific answers to your questions.\n",
      "PivotTables combine some of the most powerful and useful types of Excel functionality, such as sorting, filtering, summary functions, and subtotals, to give you an incredible level of control over how you view your data.\n",
      "When you create a PivotTable, Excel enables you place it on the same worksheet as the original data, or you can insert it on a new worksheet. Once the PivotTable is created, you can re-pivot, re- sort, re-summarize, and re-filter you data any number of times without affecting the original dataset. In addition to pivoting columns and rows, you can nest columns and rows within one another to create a hierarchy, much as you do when using subtotals. You can expand or collapse levels of hierarchy to view more or less detail in your PivotTables. And you can use any of the available summary functions to summarize your pivoted data for a variety of purposes. You can also create PivotTables out of either data in the same workbook or data from other workbooks and external data sources.\n",

      "\n",
      "Transactional Data\n",
      "There is an extremely important consideration for you to keep in mind when creating and working with PivotTables: your data format. PivotTables are designed to work with, and work best with, raw transactional data. Transactional data is not summarized in any way, so it does not contain row labels; it contains only column labels. Columns in a transactional dataset are also known as fields. The best way to visualize transactional data is to examine the root word \"transaction.\" In a transactional dataset, each transaction, or entry, is located in its own separate row. To carry on the example from earlier, of sales transactions at a variety of locations, each sale, regardless of when or where it took place, would be entered as an individual row of data. The dataset columns represent the specific elements of each transaction: date, time, location, amount, and so on.\n",
      "In a summarized dataset, even a raw one, the data has already been compiled in some way and will have row labels as well as column labels. For example, you may have raw sales data for each sales rep in your organization. Because each rep has his or her own row of data, the dataset would likely contain the total of each person's sales, as opposed to each sale regardless of the rep. Although you can create PivotTables from summary data, they will never give you as much granular insight into your data as PivotTables created from transactional data.\n",

      "Analyze PivotTable Data\n",
      "Now that you have created your PivotTable, you're ready to dive right in and crunch the numbers to gain the organizational insight that can help you succeed. As with all Excel data analysis tasks, creating and configuring effective PivotTables is a matter of asking the right questions to glean the necessary information. When working with PivotTables, this all boils down to structure. You already know PivotTables allow you to reorganize and re-analyze your data as many times as necessary to get all of the answers you're looking for. How do you translate your questions into a PivotTable structure? Actually, it's relatively simple.\n",
      "Excel 2010 provides you with many different tools and commands you can use to organize the structure of your PivotTables. Knowing how these tools work and understanding how PivotTable structure translates into actionable intelligence are the keys to getting the answers you seek.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start with Questions, End with Structure\n",
      "To create PivotTables that will be useful to you, begin by thinking about the types of questions you would like your raw data to answer. This is precisely that same type of initial analysis you perform when determining which functions or formulas to include in worksheets. The only difference here is that you will use your questions as a basis for organizing your PivotTables, not to enter a function or a formula. Once you've determined what question you want Excel to answer, you can begin to design the structure of your PivotTable.\n",
      "There are a couple of items to keep in mind before beginning this process. First, it's typically best to create rows and columns out of fields that have a fairly finite set of entries, such as sales reps, regions, or products. You may not, for example, find it very useful to create rows out of dates that occurred over a 10-year span of time as you could end up with thousands of rows of data. Second, you should create rows out of the field for which you are primarily interested in determining some fact, and create columns out of your secondary criterion. For example, if you want to know the total sales per product for each sales rep in your department, you would typically create rows out of sales reps (your primary concern) and columns out of the products (the items for which you are measuring performance). Then you would ask Excel to use the SUM function to total the sales for each rep per product.\n",

      "Now, let's say you'd like Excel to answer the following question: How many of each product was sold in each region? As you are primarily concerned with what is happening on a per-region basis, you would make regions the rows and keep the products in columns.

      "Once you create a PivotTable, you will use the PivotTable Field List pane to configure the PivotTable and perform data analysis tasks. Excel automatically opens the PivotTable Field List pane when you insert a PivotTable in a worksheet. The top half of the pane, the Choose fields to add to report section, displays a list of all of the fields (columns) from the original dataset; Excel pulls the names for these from the column labels. The bottom half of the pane, the Drag fields between areas below section, displays a series of four areas that you use to configure the PivotTable. By dragging the various fields to the various areas, you configure the structure of the PivotTable and select the values upon which Excel performs calculations.\n",
      "As PivotTables are dynamic, by default, you can drag fields to the various areas of the PivotTable Field List pane as necessary and your PivotTable will update automatically. You can move the fields around as often as you like, and you can include more than one field in each area. When you drag more than one field into the same area, Excel creates a hierarchy in the PivotTable with items on top of the area representing higher levels in the hierarchy. This works much like using subtotals and outlines in ranges.\n",

This could be helpful if you want to know what percentage of your total sales came from a particular region or which sales rep generated the highest percentage of your total or regional sales.

You now have a clear picture of which regions and which sales reps are generating your sales.\n",
      "Now take a look at what happens when you change the summary function to the AVERAGE function and change the Show Values As tab option to Difference From. Here, all of the sales rep sales averages are being compared to Robert Toner's sales, as he has the highest percentage of overall sales. You could compare the values to any individual sales rep.\n",

You know you can convert the data in your worksheet ranges and tables into visually appealing, easy-to- interpret charts. You also know that doing so makes it easier for your audience to gather meaning from all of that data with just a glance. Wouldn't it be nice if you could do the same with PivotTable data?\n",
      "The good news is that Excel 2010 provides you with a quick and easy ways to translate your PivotTable data into charts just as you can with your other data.

The main difference is simply that PivotCharts are linked to PivotTable data, whereas standard charts are linked to either a range of data or a table. As with charts, when you alter the data in a PivotTable, PivotCharts update automatically to reflect the changes. As you drag fields from one area to another, update the PivotTable data, and modify the summary function and Show Values As options, your PivotCharts will dynamically change to reflect the changes in the PivotTable.\n",
      "Excel provides you with many of the same options for formatting your PivotCharts as it does with charts, including the ability to change chart types. And, the same considerations apply for deciding which chart type to select and which chart elements you should include in your PivotCharts. Use the Insert Chart dialog box to create PivotCharts from PivotTables. To create a PivotChart, access the Insert Chart dialog box from the Charts group on the Insert tab, or select Options→Tools→PivotChart from the PivotTable Tools contextual tab.\n",

      "Filter Data by Using Slicers\n",
      "The ability to filter your PivotTables enables you to drill down into your raw data to view the fine detail that lies within. As you likely have many questions to ask of your data, it can quickly become tedious to have to open drop-down menus, determine what items are filtered out, clear the filtering, and then re-filter your data to find the next answer. This is especially true if data analysis is one of your key functions. If you fall into this category of Excel users, you'll likely appreciate the ability to quickly and easily re-filter your PivotTables on any number of fields. In addition, the ability to quickly view the filters applied to the current dataset could come in handy if you're returning to a worksheet after having not worked in it for a while.\n",
      "In short, you need some type of tool that gives you a high level of control over PivotTable filtering; one that is easy to work with and easy to interpret regardless of how many filters you apply to your PivotTables. Excel 2010 includes such a tool. Gaining an understanding of how this feature works will give you a greater level of control over your PivotTable filtering and the peace of mind knowing that you have filtered your data in precisely the manner you meant you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slicers\n",
      "Slicers are PivotTable filtering tools that you can link to various PivotTables in your worksheets. You can create a slicer out of any of the fields associated with a PivotTable, and then you can use those slicers to filter each field by any of its unique entries. Although a slicer is typically associated with a single PivotTable, you can link slicers to multiple PivotTables; this is typically done for PivotTables that are associated with the same raw dataset. This can be handy, for example, if you want to create multiple versions of the same PivotTable, create a unique structure for each to answer various questions about your data, and then filter them by the same criteria simultaneously.\n",
      "Each unique value in a field appears as a separate button on the associated slicer. By default, slicer buttons appear highlighted in blue when the filter is inactive, meaning the associated value will appear in the PivotTable. When the filter is active, meaning the value has been removed from the PivotTable, the button appears white. When you first create a slicer, all filters are inactive, so all of the buttons are highlighted in blue. Selecting a slicer button activates all of the other filters, meaning only the value you selected will appear in the table. This may, at first, seem counterintuitive, but it makes sense when you think about it in this way: selecting a button displays the associated value in a PivotTable. To select multiple slicer buttons simultaneously, press and hold down the Ctrl key while making your selections. Selecting the Clear Filter button deactivates all the filters on a slicer, meaning all values will appear in the PivotTable.\n",
      "Slicer buttons may also appear slightly grayed-out. Excel does this when some active filter has removed the associated values from view. Grayed-out slicer buttons are inactive, as you cannot filter on values that do not appear in the PivotTable. Clearing the filter that is suppressing the values from view will reactivate the associated slicer button(s).\n",
      "The default slicer formatting is blue and white, but you can customize the display of slicers to match your worksheet formatting. You can place slicers anywhere on your worksheets or resize them as you like. You can even place copies of slicers in multiple locations. The original slicer and the copies remain linked, so whatever you do to one affects the others. This is true only of filtering tasks, not visual formatting.\n",
